float: it can contaiin positive or negative decimal numbers
eg: float b= 10.5

complex: it has real part and imaginary part.
eg: c= 4+5j

 
4. Expression is a combination of operators and variables to produce a value.
Eg: c=a+b
Expressions evaluates to a single value

5. Statement represents an action whereas expression is a combination of operators and variables to produce a value.
Statement:

1. Boolean values are True and False. 
  a= True
  b= False
  
2. Boolean operators are:
  AND
  if a>b and a>c:
    print a
    
  OR
  if a>b or a>c:
  print('a is greater')    
  
  Equivalent operator
  if a==b:
    print('both are same')

3.  A   B     A AND B   A OR B   NOT A
    --------------------------------------
    0   0       0          0      1
    0   1       0          1      1
    1   0       0          1      1
    1   1       1          1      0

4. False
    False
    True
    False
    True
5. Comparison operators are 
    Equal to a==b
    Greater than a>b
    Lesse than a<b
    Not equal a!=b
    Greater than or equal to a>=b
    Lessaer than or equal to a<=b
    
6.  a=5
    b=5
    if a==b:   
       print ('both are same')
       
    Here = is the assignment operator and == is the equal to operator
    
7. spam = 0
if spam == 10:  # -->block 1
  print('eggs')
if spam > 5:   # -->block 2
  print('bacon')
else:          # -->block 3
  print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

8.
spam = 10
if spam == 10:
  print('hello')
elif spam > 5:
  print('howdy')
else:
  print('greetings')

9    Press ctrl +C key

10. Break: If the break statement is inside a nested loop, the break statement will terminate the innermost loop

  Continue: The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. 
  Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration.
  
11.range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) - all three cases will print 0 to 9

12.
FOR loop
for i in range(1,11):
    print (i)
    
WHILE LOOP
i=1
while i<11:
    print(i)
    i=i+1
    
13.

def bacon():
    print('test')
